## What is DevOps?
DevOps is more than a buzzword; it's a transformative approach to software development and IT operations. It fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, breaking down silos and creating a culture of shared responsibility. Think of it as a dynamic duo, ensuring smooth and efficient software delivery from coding to deployment.
## AWS DevOps Model Defined
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
